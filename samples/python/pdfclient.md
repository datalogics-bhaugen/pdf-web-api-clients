The Datalogics PDF API is a RESTful interface that provides secure,
cloud-based PDF processing capability based on the Adobe PDF Library.
The first release of this service implements the features of our
[PDF2IMG](http://www.datalogics.com/products/pdf2img/index.asp) product.

To facilitate using this service, we supply a sample Python
[script](classpdf2img_1_1_p_d_f2_i_m_g.html) and
[client](classpdfclient_1_1_client.html) module.
